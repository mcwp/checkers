checkers
========

Checker bits - a work in progress.  This is a learning tangent (making checkers) 
that spun off from another learning project (making dominoes) when I stumbled upon 
an unfinished, only slightly buggy checkers game on Codeacademy.  The dominoes 
learning project was a tangent spun off from learning about web sockets, which was
inspired by the lighttable demo on the kaazing website.  For some reason that
inspired me to make a dominoes game to play with my sister, rather than just moving
pretty pictures around.  And that seemed like a good learning project for learning
web sockets in general, specifically with pub/sub messaging, which I wanted to 
learn about for another project...
